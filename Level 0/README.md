# Changes made

I have made some changes to my liking and made a portfolio of my own.

# Deployment 

I have deployed the website using netlify. It was very easy and effecient with no complex instructions.

## Problems faced

I could not figure out how to deploy one particular website when I have multiple pages in a repository. So I had to take out the level I was working on and deploy manually.
